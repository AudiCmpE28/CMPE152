/* Project #1: Lexer and Token */

1. If you use command line
To compile in command line, enter the src directory and run

javac symbols/*.java
javac lexer/*.java
javac main/Main.java

2. To run the lexer in command line:
java  main.Main

To run with a file:
java  main.Main < test_file


For this project, we added a function named "getNextToken()" in
the lexer file. If there is a \r carriage, it handles it to move
to the next line. We also created a new HashMap to keep track of 
token labels, which if not found by being matched with token tag
are then stored into the has map.

For example:
&& is in hash map, this when it prints it will use its tag to retrieve
token label and print as "AND &&".
If the token is { or }, then it will be stored it with tag number to 
later print in main such as "{ {".

Finally, in main we found that token is '\uFFFF' when EOF, thus from main
will break and end program since there is nothing else to read.
